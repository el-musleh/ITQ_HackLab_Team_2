## 🏆 Challenge

| | |
|---|---|
| **Track** | ITQ — Autonomous Detection and Collection of Bottle Caps with Computer Vision |
| **Prize** | 200€ cash |
| **Time Limit** | 5 minutes per run |
| **Scoring** | Caps collected (primary) + completion time + safety penalty |
| **Win Condition** | Most caps with **zero collisions** |

**Strategy:** Safe and steady beats fast and reckless. Every collision costs you.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

All code runs on the **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** via **WiFi + Jupyter Notebook**.

### 1. Connect to the Jetson
```
# No SSH needed — Jupyter is already running on the robot
# 1. Connect laptop to WiFi: TP-LINK_744C (password: 15253354)
# 2. Open browser: http://192.168.0.100:8888/lab
# 3. Enter password: CIC@Tics1XAI
```

### 2. Open Jupyter Lab in Browser
```
# Jupyter is already running on the Jetson
# Open on your laptop browser:
http://192.168.0.100:8888/lab

# Password: CIC@Tics1XAI
```

### 3. Clone the Project (First Time Only)
In a Jupyter terminal (File → New → Terminal):
```bash
cd /workspace
git clone https://github.com/el-musleh/ITQ_HackLab_Team_2.git itq-bottle-cap-collector
cd itq-bottle-cap-collector
```

### 4. Run the Calibration Notebook
```
In Jupyter:
1. Navigate to itq-bottle-cap-collector/notebooks/
2. Open 01_calibrate.ipynb
3. Run cells top-to-bottom (Shift+Enter)
```

---

## 🔄 Daily Jupyter Workflow

This is how the team works during the hackathon:

### Step 1: Power On & Connect
```
# 1. Turn on JETANK (battery switch)
# 2. Wait 60 seconds for Jetson to boot
# 3. Connect laptop to WiFi: TP-LINK_744C
# 4. Open Jupyter: http://192.168.0.100:8888/lab
# 5. Password: CIC@Tics1XAI
```

### Step 2: Open Browser & Navigate
- Open `http://192.168.0.100:8888/lab` on laptop
- Enter password: `CIC@Tics1XAI`
- Navigate to the project folder

### Step 3: Work in Notebooks
Each module has its own notebook:

| Notebook | Purpose | Who |
|----------|---------|-----|
| `01_calibrate.ipynb` | Camera color/light calibration | Yashveer |
| `02_test_camera.ipynb` | Verify CSI camera capture | Yashveer |
| `03_test_servos.ipynb` | Test arm + chassis servos | Mohammad |
| `04_test_sensors.ipynb` | Read ultrasonic / IR distances | Myron |
| `05_detection_demo.ipynb` | Live cap detection overlay | Yashveer |
| `06_full_run.ipynb` | End-to-end autonomous run | Team |

### Step 4: Test & Iterate
```python
# Typical cell pattern in every notebook
import cv2
from hardware.camera import JetsonCamera
from perception.detector import CapDetector

cam = JetsonCamera()
detector = CapDetector()

frame = cam.read()
detections = detector.find_caps(frame)

# Show result
cv2.imshow('debug', detector.draw_overlay(frame, detections))
```

### Step 5: Save & Commit
```bash
# In Jupyter Terminal (New → Terminal)
cd ~/itq-bottle-cap-collector
git add notebooks/03_test_servos.ipynb
git commit -m "test: servo angles for arm pickup motion"
git push
```

---

## 🐍 From Notebook to `.py` Module

When a notebook cell works, convert it to a module:

```bash
# Convert notebook to Python script
jupyter nbconvert --to script notebooks/05_detection_demo.ipynb
# Creates: notebooks/05_detection_demo.py

# Then move the function into the real module
mv notebooks/05_detection_demo.py perception/detector.py
```

Or manually: copy the working cell into the `.py` file in the right package folder.

## ⚡ Jupyter Tips for Jetson Nano

| Tip | Why |
|-----|-----|
| **Restart kernel often** | Jetson has limited RAM (4GB). Restart clears leaked memory from OpenCV frames. |
| **Close figure windows** | `cv2.destroyAllWindows()` before running the next cell. |
| **Use `%matplotlib inline`** | Prevents extra GUI windows that crash headless Jetson. |
| **Limit camera resolution** | `cam.set_resolution(320, 240)` — smaller frames = faster detection + less RAM. |
| **One notebook at a time** | Running multiple notebooks eats RAM. Close finished tabs. |
| **Save before every run** | Jetson can freeze under load. `Ctrl+S` is your friend. |

## 🧠 State Machine

The robot's brain is a single reusable state machine in `control/state_machine.py` that runs on both the real robot and the simulator.

Main flow:
`IDLE → WANDERING → CHECK_FOR_BALL → COLLECT_BALL → CHECK_FOR_BALL → BALLS_LEFT → BLIND_SPOT → END`

- `IDLE` initializes sensors and aborts on hard failures.
- `WANDERING` sweeps the camera, registers balls into the world map, and calibrates the basket.
- `CHECK_FOR_BALL` decides whether to collect a ball, check the map, or explore blind spots.
- `COLLECT_BALL` tracks the ball, picks it up, returns to the basket, and deposits it.
- `BALLS_LEFT` picks the nearest known ball from the map.
- `BLIND_SPOT` visits candidate viewpoints to find hidden balls.
- `END` returns to the starting corner and stops.
- `RECOVERY` handles transient failures with retries.

A dedicated safety supervisor overrides all states when a yellow boundary or obstacle is detected.

See `docs/state-machine.md` for the full diagram and tuning parameters.

## 🛠️ Setup

### Hardware: Waveshare JETANK
| Component | Spec |
|-----------|------|
| **Platform** | NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit |
| **Chassis** | Tracked, high-torque DC geared motors |
| **Arm** | 4-DOF servo-driven robot arm |
| **Camera** | CSI camera (Jetson onboard) |
| **Programming** | WiFi + Jupyter Notebook |
| **Servo Bus** | SCSCtrl protocol |

> [JETANK GitHub Repo](https://github.com/waveshare/JETANK) — official examples for servo control, color tracking, motion detection, and gamepad control.

### Prerequisites (on Jetson Nano)
- JetPack 4.x+ installed
- Python 3.6+ (comes with Jetson)
- WiFi connected
- Git

### One-Command Setup (All Team Members)
```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/el-musleh/ITQ_HackLab_Team_2.git
cd ITQ_HackLab_Team_2

# 2. Run the setup script (installs everything)
./setup.sh

# 3. Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Start working
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888
```

**What `setup.sh` does:**
1. Installs system dependencies (`python3-pip`, `git`, `libgl1`, etc.)
2. Creates a Python virtual environment (`venv/`)
3. Installs Python packages (OpenCV, NumPy, PySerial, Ultralytics, Jupyter)
4. Installs the `SCSCtrl` servo library from local source
5. Creates the project directory structure
6. Generates starter files (`main.py`, `config.yaml`)
7. Verifies all installations

### Manual Dependencies (if setup.sh fails)
```bash
# Core (Jetson-optimized)
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib pyserial imutils

# JETANK servo control
pip install -e .  # from project root, installs SCSCtrl

# Detection (optional — color blob may be enough)
pip install ultralytics
```

### Hardware Checklist
- [ ] Jetson Nano booted and WiFi connected
- [ ] JETANK chassis assembled and tracked motors test-driven
- [ ] 4-DOF arm servos responding to SCSCtrl commands
- [ ] CSI camera capturing frames in OpenCV
- [ ] Ultrasonic / IR sensors reading distances
- [ ] Bottle cap "collection" mapped to arm motion (grab + lift + drop)
- [ ] Battery pack charged (spare recommended)
- [ ] Laptop can reach Jetson at `http://192.168.0.100:8888/lab`

## 🎯 MVP Definition

Before building anything fancy, the robot must:

1. Drive forward without crashing
2. See a bottle cap with the camera
3. Stop near the cap
4. Trigger a collection action

**Rule:** Nothing else gets built until MVP works. Optimization is a luxury; functionality is the requirement.

## ⚠️ Risk Register

| Risk | P | I | Mitigation |
|------|---|---|------------|
| False cap detection | M | H | HSV primary + YOLO backup; multi-frame validation |
| Stuck in corner | M | H | Timeout recovery: reverse tracks + rotate 45° |
| Collision | L | **C** | Conservative speed in APPROACH; ultrasonic / IR stop-distance |
| Battery failure | L | H | Fresh battery per run; voltage telemetry |
| Bad lighting | M | M | On-site calibration; wide HSV thresholds |
| Hardware failure | L | H | Recorded demo video as fallback |
